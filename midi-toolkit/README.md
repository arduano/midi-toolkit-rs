# Midi Toolkit for Rust

A library for ultra high performance MIDI operations, designed for black MIDI.

I wrote this library as my first ever Rust project, and it's evolved since then into something fairly advanced, but it still has some rough spots.

The documentation is also very patchy. I can update the documentation if someone actually needs this library and I get time to work on it.

See the midi-toolkit/examples folder for some examples of how to use the library. Though last time I checked, there were errors in those files.
